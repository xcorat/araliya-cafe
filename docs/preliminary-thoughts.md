# Ideas for a crypto cafe and hackerspace #

*I just randomly chose the name [Araliya](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=araliya&t=brave&iax=images&ia=images) as a play on rice-politics in srilanka, so don't mind the name. That said, I do think the sense of what this cafe should mean [EXPAND] would go well with a name like that.*

This is just a collection of ideas, and probably better taken as possibilities and opportunities than necessarily a plan.

## Possibilities ##

I'm thinking this would be a mulit-purpose space that tap into some **counter-culture** trends, but focused on more futuristic ideas like crypto. We can divide the space into more cafe-like and more we-work like spaces. The front/entrance are would be the cafe where more food/coffee oriented clients and people who are mostly socializing can hangout (Ideally a mix of some couches, some bar+stools and tables), while the workspace would ideally be a little removed from that area with more tables, and maybe some reservable rooms/tables with screens. Having a balcony/outdoor space too would be perfect.


### 1. Cafe and Social Space ###

I guess there are a bunch of cafes in Colombo where people can go hangout, work and also socialize. We can make this a similar space and have social events at evening/night to attract people.

#### a. Cafe and Food
The cafe can serve snacks and light food. We can include some niche food items that come from different cultures to give the feeling that this is an international space.

Ex. Pol-sambal panini, Cevice, Fried Yucca dishes, Brazilian-Srilankan fusion savory snacks, salads like tabouleh etc. Somewhat uncommon ingredients we can use are Avacado (as a vegetable, not as a fruit), goat cheese, spicy chillie oils, quiona, sprouts etc. The prices would target urban middle/upper-middle class customers. If it is possible to have an alocohol licence, we can also offer beers, especially for evening events.

#### b. Social Events
We can host weekly/bi-weekly events to attract customers and create a space for cultural exchange. Fri/Sat evenings, Sunday afternoon would be a nice time so that it doesn't obstruct working atmosphere the other times.
Ex:
+ Live music (light music) in the eves ,
+ Poetry club - Ideally we can make these events more international, try to find non-local participants and give a true 'melting-pot' experience. Maybe we can find hostels, other expat commuinities to host events
+ Comedy nights,

#### c. Info to be collected
+ Some examples of similar places in Colombo: Barrista, ...
+ What are the rents, square footage, location and the clientelle
+ Prices/customers/numbers

### 2. Workspace - Hackerspace ###
The workspace can be a regular place where people can come and remotely work. Ideally some division between different areas (multiple quasi-open rooms) where multiple groups can work. We can have some rooms and booths for people who might need privacy.

#### a. Workspace 
#### b. Space for collaborative projects

### 3. Social Events ###

### 4. Crypto Events ###

 + Crypto project presentations
 + Introductory lectures
 + Networking events
 + Crypto related art events (I would love if this can take priority)

### 5. Crypto projects ###
#### a. Decentralized news
Started playing with [this](https://github.com/xcorat/denewz-0) but haven't gotten anywhere. ... ([hosted here](https://denewz-alpha.netlify.app/#/))
#### b. Crypto-Cafe
+ Create a token for rewards *(like, get 10 coffees, you get one free, but instead of punch card, we give out NFT tokens)*, we can also use this to reserve spaces (like desks with monitors, private rooms etc). Since anyone can send this to anyone else, these tokans can actually create a market driving the (early-)paricipatory value up.
+ Make a DAO - make the cafe a co-op, governed by the workers and users who hold a crypto token.

## Opportunities ##

### Socio-political and cultural opennings

How politics, social and cultural dynamics can be leveraged into building a counter-culter.

### Economic

The econimic value of the space is mainly through it's function as a hackerspace for new creative talents in crypto/blockchain arena. If people come work together, make new cool projects, VCs can come and invest in these projects or hire people, providing value for these investors.
