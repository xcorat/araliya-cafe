## Ideas for a crypto cafe and hackerspace ##

*I just randomly chose the name [araliya](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=araliya&t=brave&iax=images&ia=images)
as a play on rice-politics in srilanka, so don't mind the name. 
That said, I do think the sense of what this cafe should mean would go well with a name like that.*

This is just a collection of ideas, and probably better taken as possibilities and opportunities than a plan.

### Possibilities ###

I'm thinking this would be a mulit-purpose space that tap into some counter-culture trends, but focused on 
more futuristic ideas like crypto. We divide the space into more cafe-like and more we-work like spaces.

#### 1. Cafe ####
#### 2. Social Space ####
#### 3. Workspace ####
#### 4. Hackerspace ####
